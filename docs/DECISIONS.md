# Decisions

Core engineering decisions: short, dated, with reasons. Science decisions live in the engine's
`docs/DECISIONS.md`; open proposals in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §9.

## C-001 Workers compute blocks of consecutive dates (2026-11-10)
Product intent: each day is computed from T alone and its transient data destroyed. Blocks keep that
property and only share the download: a cold day spends ~200 of its ~360 min downloading (parity run,
2026-11-09), and consecutive days share most of the 132-session quote window. Every day must be a pure
function of (T, the provider's data, the declared windows) whatever block or position computes it;
the block-start test proves it (a block's first day equals the same day computed mid-block).

## C-002 Orchestration: DOKS with an always-on data box (owner, 2026-11-10; ARCHITECTURE D3)
DigitalOcean Kubernetes in nyc1: one fixed core node (`s-4vcpu-8gb-amd`, $56/month) runs Postgres,
the vyreon-core service and KEDA; worker pools autoscale 0..N; one KEDA ScaledJob per job type reads
the claimable count from Postgres. The job table is the source of truth; Kubernetes only runs
containers. Rejected: self-hosted k3s (we would write the node autoscaler), a separate data-box
droplet beside a zero-node cluster (two systems to deploy), scripted droplets without Kubernetes.

## C-003 Postgres: CloudNativePG on the core node (owner, 2026-11-10; ARCHITECTURE D4)
The standard Postgres operator for Kubernetes: data on a DigitalOcean volume, continuous backup
(base backups + WAL) to Spaces, restore drilled. Accepted cost: minutes of downtime when the node is
replaced at an upgrade we schedule. DigitalOcean managed Postgres stays the fallback (more cost).

## C-004 Kept data: Intrinio is the store; Spaces holds the perishables (owner, 2026-11-10)
Only what Intrinio will not serve again is kept (option prints, ACT01 pulls, company captures), plus
the outputs. Bucket `vyreon-data` (nyc3) receives the droplet's nightly archive
(`deploy/droplet/archive-perishables.sh`; copy, never sync). Pre-launch losses are tolerated:
integrity is verifiable only from launch day.

## C-005 FIELD deferred until the backfill is complete (owner, 2026-11-10; ARCHITECTURE D8)
FIELD is a stated absence on days without the full 64 members; its membership rulings are made with
the whole history in hand, then a FIELD-scoped recompute.

## C-006 No separate measurement phase (owner, 2026-11-10)
The cold day on 8 vCPU is measured (parity, 2026-11-09: download 200 min, compute 160 min, peak disk
44.7 GB). The rest (a warm day inside a block, the block-start effect, tape cost per session, the size
of a day's derive inputs, a day on 4 vCPU) is measured on the cluster's first blocks, on the code
path that will actually run, leaving the droplet to its daily capture.

## C-007 vyreon-core is written in Rust (2026-11-10; ARCHITECTURE D9)
It reuses the engine's crates (sensor registry, coordinates, store logic) as pinned git dependencies
and the engine API's stack (axum, tokio-postgres), so the store's types and checks are shared, not
re-implemented. Rust is the default; Python only where necessary (owner, 2026-11-10).
